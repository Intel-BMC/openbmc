Subject: [PATCH] PFR- Skip counting WDT2 event when EXTRST# is set

PFR CPLD drives EXTRST# of BMC to reset it during
firmware update and during recovery. On ast2500 the
EXTRST# is also setting WDT2/3 flags which is counted
as boot failures by u-boot and aborts the boot if
boot failures are more than 3. This change will skip
counting WDT2 flag if EXTRST# is also set in SCU3C.

Tested: Verified BMC updates 4 times and checked that
        the boot is not aborted at u-boot.
