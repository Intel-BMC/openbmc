Subject: [PATCH] Enable GPIOE0 and GPIOE2 pass-through by default

This change sets the gpio DT pinctrl default configuration to
enable GPIOE0 and GPIOE2 pass-through.  Since this causes
pinctrl_get_select_default() to be called automatically for
the gpio driver to claim the GPIO pins in those groups, we
also need to call pinctrl_put() to release claim on the
pass-through GPIOs so they can be requested at runtime.

Tested:
Disabled pass-through in uboot and confirmed that after booting
Linux, pass-through is enabled and 'cat /sys/kernel/debug/pinctrl/
1e6e2000.syscon\:pinctrl-aspeed-g5-pinctrl/pinmux-pins' shows that
the pass-through GPIOs are UNCLAIMED.
