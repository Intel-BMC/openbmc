Subject: [PATCH] Add bus-timeout-ms and #retries device tree properties

BMC uses I2C bus 7 as a PMBus channel to communicate with PSUs,
also ME uses this bus as SMLink to control PSUs so this bus is
managed by multi-masters. In this use case, some arbitration errors
are expected so we need to add retry logic. And PMBus subsystem
uses I2C bus in kernel internally so retry logic should be
supported in kernel level.

To support the use case, this commit adds 'bus-timeout-ms' and
'#retries' device tree properties to set the bus specific
parameters at kernel boot time without using any additional ioctls
from user space.

This patch would not be accepted by I2C maintainer in linux
upstream because he doesn't like adding these legacy properties
into device tree, so keep it only in downstream.

 Binding may contain optional "interrupts" property, describing interrupts
 used by the device. I2C core will assign "irq" interrupt (or the very first
 interrupt if not using interrupt names) as primary interrupt for the slave.
