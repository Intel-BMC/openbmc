Subject: [PATCH] Unconditionally calculate the PECI AW FCS

The PECI write commands that include the AW FCS byte were failing due
to the way AW FCS bytes were being managed. The current paradigm
permitted in the Redfish interface was to allow the AW FCS byte to be
omitted. The peci-core logic attempted to create the AW FCS byte. The
algorithm being used left the possibility of a bad FCS byte being
appended to the PECI command.

This change manages the issue by always overwriting the AW FCS byte
with a value freshly calculated from the write payload. The user
supplying the AW FCS byte no longer matters.

Tested:
Submitted this PECI sequence:
48 10 1 165 0 26 0 0 223 134 21 0

The sequence was sent from Redfish, and a return code of 0x40
resulted.
Prior to this the sequence would report 0x90.

Supplied the same sequence to "peci_cmds raw" in the console.
It failed because the number of bytes did not include the AW FCS
byte. Adding any additional byte allows the command to succeed.
