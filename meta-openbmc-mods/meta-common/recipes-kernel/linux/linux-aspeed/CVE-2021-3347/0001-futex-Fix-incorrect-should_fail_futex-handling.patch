Subject: [PATCH] futex: Fix incorrect should_fail_futex() handling

[ Upstream commit 921c7ebd1337d1a46783d7e15a850e12aed2eaa0 ]

If should_futex_fail() returns true in futex_wake_pi(), then the 'ret'
variable is set to -EFAULT and then immediately overwritten. So the failure
injection is non-functional.

Fix it by actually leaving the function and returning -EFAULT.

The Fixes tag is kinda blury because the initial commit which introduced
failure injection was already sloppy, but the below mentioned commit broke
it completely.

[ tglx: Massaged changelog ]

Fixes: 6b4f4bc9cb22 ("locking/futex: Allow low-level atomic operations to return -EAGAIN")
