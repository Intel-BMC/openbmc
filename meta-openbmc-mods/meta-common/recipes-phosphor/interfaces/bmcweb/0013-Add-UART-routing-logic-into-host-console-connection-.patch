Subject: [PATCH] Add UART routing logic into host console connection flow

Switching UART routing when starting obmc-service introduces garbled
character printing out on physical host serial output and it's
inevitable so this commit moves the routing logic into host console
connection flow in bmcweb to avoid the issue until SOL is actually
activated.

Tested: The garbled character printing out was not observed during
BMC booting. SOL worked well.
